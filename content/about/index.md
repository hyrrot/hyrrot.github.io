### About this web site

The website provides the ability to write down Hyrrot's thoughts on daily life and, when necessary, to record and publish Hyrrot's open-source artifacts.

I will make every effort to provide articles in both Japanese/English, but for various reasons, some articles will be available in only one of the languages. Thanks for your understanding.
