### About this web site

The title of this website, "Pays des Merveilles d'Hyrrot" is French and translates to "Hyrrot's Wonderland" in English.

Hyrrot writes down his thoughts in his daily life and, when necessary, records and publishes Hyrrot's open-source artifacts. He also wants to find and try out some interesting technology, and in that respect, it is a "wonderland" as the title suggests.
